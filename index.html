            <p>The involvement of extracurriculars in youth today is not only beneficial but deeply important in the regards of socializing, positive activity, and participation. Many schools and communities of well established funding are able to provide a plethora of opprotunities to get involved, meanwhile communties of low-income have little to no proper funding to get youth programs off the ground or even keep them running. Lack of extracurriculars in impoverished communities can lead to many negative impacts and habits within young people which can result to addiction, crime, incarceration, and even death. Within this project, I will express how exactly does the lack of extracurriculars in low-funded schools and communities affect young people and students, in addition, explore how the increase of activies for the youth could be beneficial towards their everyday lives. I plan to presnt my work through an interactive essay, where more informatin within and amongst my piece will be avalible to the user through images and statistics. A main challenge within this is not very much the research and information, but the coding and artistic ability to bring it all together as one.
